## Public Reporting of HAIs in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania was the first state to publically report the volume and cost of healthcare-associated infections. [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) All state reports of HAIs and HAI prevention plans are also published by the CDC at [cdc.gov/hai/stateplans/](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/stateplans/state-hai-plans/pa.html).

### PHC4 Report (2005)
 The Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) released the first state-wide HAI report in 2006 (for 2005 calendar year). [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) This summarized the HAI prevelency and impact in Pennsylvania:
- Infection rate of 12.2/1000 cases
- 394,000 infection-related hospital days
- $3.5B in hospital charges
- For an average commercially-insured patient, the cost of a hospital stay increases from $8,000 to $54,000 if an infection is acquired.


### ACT 52  
In 2007, Pennsylvania passed the **Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error (MCARE) Act**. This act targeted patient safety by imrpoving the eduction and prevention of healthcare-associated infections [[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#6)

>Act 52 of 2007 requires certain healthcare facilities in Pennsylvania to report healthcare-associated
>infections to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council 
>and the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
>National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for hospitals Pennsylvania Patient Safety Reporting System 
>(PA-PSRS) an electronic reporting system for nursing homes. The Act is part of the Governor's "Prescription 
>for Pennsylvania" plan to reduce and eliminate healthcare associated infections.  
>-_Quoted from PA Bulletin Notice_ [[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#7)

This act, passed within 12 months of the first PHC4 report is clear commitment by the Pennsylvania government to react to the revealing data and prevent future harm.

### HAI Improvement
Since the initial report released by PHC4, the HAI infection rate has decreased to 11.3/1000 cases. [[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#8) The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, which has approximately 70,000 central line patient days annually, reduced the associated infection rate by 30% in a single year. [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) 

Despite these improvements, heathcare-associated infections still represent significant harm among patients in Pennsylvania. The 2010 PHC4 report (released in 2012) quantified the negative impacts of HAIs including increased mortality rate (9.1%, compared to 1.7% without an HAI), increased average length of stay (21.9, compared to 5.0 days without an HAI), and readmission rates within 30 days (41.9%, compared to 16.3% without an HAI).

While public reporting has led to some improvements in patient safety, interventions and harm mitigation initiatives should be a continued focus.
