## Institute of Medicine Report
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report, "_To Err is Human_". The purpose of the investigation and publication was to bring attention and focus to healthcare safety. The report revealed that medical errors occurring in hospitals caused between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths of Americans each year. [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

### Impact of IOM Report
The Institute of Medicine's 1999 report is largely credited as the impetus for nationwide efforts to study and improve healthcare safety. Hospitals were motivated to adopt more safety practices, and often create new roles or departments focused on patient safety. [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) The public reporting of medical errors in hospitals led to both public and industry focus, as well as regionally and nationally-based improvement initiatives to promote safe practices and set infection-prevention goals. 

>#### Measurement of Impact: A 2003 Review  
>Lamb et. al. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) completed a national study aimed at quntifying imrpovements in safety in the years immediately following the Institue of Medicine's "_To Err is Human_". The study included for-profit and non-profit hospitals, selected by stratified random sampling (by faculty size and geographic region) from hospitals with 200 or more beds. 
>
>Only one in three responding hospitals had board-approved disclosure policies for safety events. However 80% either had polices in place or under development. 
>
>As part of the review, disclosures were described and classified by the following six elements:
>- Explanation
>- Undertaking to investigate the incident
>- Apology
>- Achnkowledgement of harm
>- Declaration of responsibility
>- Promise to share investigation results with patients/families   
>
>Of the hosptials included in the study, 17% routinely released disclosures with all six of the above elements. 

Despite the attention brought to patient safety by "_To Err is Human_", there is disagreement on whether safety outcomes have been improved. While there have been well-documented interventions in reaction to public reporting analysis, the outcome measures of patient safety are inconsistently impacted. In totality, it is generally believed the change has occured at a slower rate than the urgency called for by the report. [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)
