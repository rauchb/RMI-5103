## Safety Events
In a healthcare setting, safety emphasizes the absence of medical errors, specifically errors that could negatively affect clinical and health outcomes. A safety event is _“any process, act of omission, or commissions that causes hazardous health care conditions or unintended harm to the patient.”_ [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) Efforts to mitigate safety events are commonly referred to as **harm prevention**. 

In a 2005 analysis, harm was found to be most associated with therapeutic intent of an activity, language barriers, errors of judgement, communication from another office, mistiming of procedure, and medication errors. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

### Types of Safety Events
Safety events are typically classified into three categories, depending on the severity and impact to the patient. [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3)  

| Safety Event | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Medical error | Low | A mistake that did not affect the patient's health |
| Near-miss | Medium | A potential adverse event identified before it caused harm to the patient |
| Adverse event | High | A patient's health was negatively impacted as a result of healthcare professionals |

### Disclosure of Preventable Harm

Hospitals, especially those with major concerns for malpractice implications, were less likely to disclose preventable harm outcomes, compared to non-preventable outcomes of comparable severity. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) This tendency would effect the accuracy of public reporting, and inhibit the abilize to accurate analyze the most common causes of preventable harm. 

## Healthcare-Associated Infections
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are caused by devices used in medical procedures or in the course of treatment by a healthcare professional. [[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#8) The most common HAIs are central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary-tract infections (CAUTI), and surgical site infection (SSI). Since there is a negative impact on the patient's health, a HAI is considered a safety event.
