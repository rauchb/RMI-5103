To break cycle, need just culture for reporting events, streamline the reporting process, decrease time needed to complete reports, and develop essential feedback loops when providers report system failures<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>.

Reporting alone will not improve patient safety; data collected must lead to the implementation of changes to the care systems.

Improvement efforts with the primary outcome measure as the number of safety events reported have been shown to be effective<sup>[[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#5)</sup>. However, it is not necessary to rely exclusively on reporting. Voluntary error reporting can be supplemented with triggers for chart review, observation, and integrated proactive quality improvement (QI) programs.
