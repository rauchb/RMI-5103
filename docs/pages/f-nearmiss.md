A **near miss** is defined in the Joint Commissionâ€™s sentinel event program to mean events that did not have a significant outcome but might have if the situation had been repeated. Similarly, "good catches" is a synonymous term used to describe events caught before they harmed the patient<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>.

A survey revealed that 22.2% of nurses and physicians do not feel it is important to report error that did not reach the patient, and 13.9% do not feel it is important to report error that did not harm the patient<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. There is a clear disconnect between the benefits of reporting near miss events and the perceived benefits by medical staff.

With the goal of reducing risk exposures due to underreporting medical errors, improving the reporting of these events that do not reach the patient is more important than adverse event reporting. First, this is an ideal area to target for QI interventions, since the fear of blame or retribution is reduced in the absence of patient harm. Secondly, good catches can inform gaps in the patient care systems prior to events occuring. Following this, root cause analysis can bring to light **latent errors** and PDSA cycles can be implemented to fix these systems, all before patient harm occurs.
