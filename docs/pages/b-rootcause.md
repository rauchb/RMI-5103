There are a growing number of studies that examine the barriers to reporting medical errors. The most commonly cited causes of underreporting are captured below.

Commonly, the system for reporting errors involves (or has the perception of involving) disciplinary action for the individual who reported the event, or a peer or that indivdual who may be held responsible. Hospital staff reported that this environment makes submitting error reports feels like "tattling" on their coworkers and team members<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>. There is also a fear of retaliation or legal action<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>.  

A survey of the reasons nurses and physicians do not report all medical errors found that 37.0% are concerned about implicating others. In addition, 40.7% are unsure what is considered a medical error<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. The latter indicates a lack of clear definitions, a prerequisit for any valid measurement or data collection. 

The same survey found that 15.7% of staff found the incident report form too complicated. Improving the ease of event submission has been found to increase the quantity of events reported<sup>[[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. An expedited reporting system would alleviate the barrier of conflicting priorities as well. Nurses and physicians with heavy patient care demands very rarely have dedicated time to report errors. Therefore, even an individual with a strong belief in the importance of reporting will have to compete against daily required tasks. 

In systems without transparency or without clear policies, there may be confusion about whose responsibility it is to report a medical error. The belief that someone else has reported the event is a common cause for an individual not reporting themselves<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>. Physicians, especially, commonly express that they don't believe error reporting is a primary function of their job as medical providers. 

Finally, many studies have found that providers don't dunerstand the importance or reporting, particularly for events that did not reach the patient. This sentiment increases in nurses with more than five years' experience, with 52.5% reporting they beleived there was no point in reporting near misses<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2),[[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#3)</sup>.
