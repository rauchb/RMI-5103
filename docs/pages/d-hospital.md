Risk analysis includes quantifying the frequency and severity of risks. Underreporting will impact the assigned frequency, lessening the overall perceived risk for that exposure. Risk management teams cannot properly prioritize the biggest risks, because they do not understand the underlying causes of errors. Underreporting causes an inability to predict future losses. Risk management initiatives will not be supported if the magnitude of the exposure is not fully understood. 

Medical errors that are reported are not a representative sample of all errors committed<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Staff are more likely to report incidents which are well known, often witnessed, and commonly responded to, such as falls and medication errors. Long-developing safety events (particularly near misses) such as pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis were least likely to be reported<sup>[[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#3)</sup>.

>*Patient safety programs that leverage error rates as their principal safety metric are operating on flawed data that could lead to incorrect prioritization of safety improvement efforts.* - Scanlon et. al.<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>

A well-established safety culture that is promoted and supported by leadership has a positive impact on provider well-being, job satisfaction, and reduced burnout<sup>[[]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>. These in turn have a direct effect on patient safety, meaning the inverse (a lack of safety culture) will further impact patient safety events. Additionally, these engagement factors of the staff pose a risk to staff retention.  A negative or punitive reporting culture therefore presents a personnel hazard, with the risk of burnout or resignations.  

Financially, the risks to patient safety can impact hospitals in three primary ways: 
- Incurred cost of treating adverse patient outcomes due to unmitigated medical errors.
- Reputational impact (and in extreme cases, accredidation impacts) due to manditory reporting of sentinel events.
- Litigation costs of malpractice or other lawsuits.
