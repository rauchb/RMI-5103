Medical errors are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with the Institue of Medicine estimating up to 98,000 deaths annually from this single cause <sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Errors that lead to adverse events, such as patient harm, are **preventable medical errors**. Underreporting of adverse events has been estimated between 50% and 96% annually.
> The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines an error as *the failure of a planned action to be carried out as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim*<sup>[[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#8)</sup> 

There is significant underreporting of medical errors, but the severity and rate of underreporting is largely unknown. In one study at Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, 45.9% of physicians and 10.5% of nurses surveyed reported zero incidents (errors or near misses) in the last 12 months. In addition, 40.8% of providers responding to this survey indicated that less than half of errors they committed were reported<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. The New York state hospitals compared 176 voluntarily self-reported sentinel events to 11,028 reports collected through their NYPORTS system<sup>[[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#4)</sup>.

Preventing medical errors requires an accurate collection of data on the occurrence, frequency, types, and outcomes of medical errors. The most prevalent form of data collection for this information is incident reporting. Many healthcare organizations utilize error-based patient safety metrics. Error reporting requires identification of the error and action of reporting. Underreporting can occur when either of these steps fail<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>.   

Patient safety movement brings risk management to the forefront of clinical care – providing the opportunity for preventative measures – compared to the traditional post-event litigation approach. Predicable processes that produce dependable patient safety outcomes require a just culture, open reporting systems, and teamwork and communication across multiple disciplines<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>.

Error reduction efforts require data on the occurrence of errors, and underreporting provides an incomplete dataset<sup>[[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#8)</sup>.
