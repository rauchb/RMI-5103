## Public Reporting

Public reporting is the practice of collecting a set of data for the purpose of releasing broadly and free of charge. This data may be related to healthcare structures, processes, or outcomes; the report may be released at the provider, institution, or health plan level of detail. [[11]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#11) Recently, public reporting has been a highly visible and pertinent topic, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debate of whether aggregate healthcare data should be publicly available as a "right" to all patients is, in some cases, an ongoing debate. While full transparency may be controversial, there are limited adverse effects to public reporting. 

In addition to improving transparency, public reporting is a mechanism for improving quality and patient safety. [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) As outlined on the [Improving Safety](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/reporting-improving-safety.html) page, reporting does not immediately lead to improvement. Rather, public reporting enables analysis and creates opportunity for targeted intervention. Without the two latter steps, there is small likelihood of improvement of patient safety.
