## Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS)
Public reporting is only possible when individual events are recognized and reported to the institution by staff. This micro-level reporting is increased by anonymous reporting, meaningful feedback, and greater ease to report. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) An extensive, non-U.S. study found that simplicity and anonymity of reporting significantly improves rates of reporting safety events. [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3) The patient safety reporting system, or PSRS, is the portal for these incidents to be recorded; it is a crucial step in public reporting. 

>#### Case Study: Impact of ICUSRS  
>Pronovost et. al. [[9]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#9) implemented a web-based PSRS called the Intensive Care Unit Safety Reporting System (ICUSRS) at multiple participating sites. The system was designed not only as a mechanism for anonymously reporting incidents, but also to identify and mitigate hazards.

>One hospital identified insufficient staff knowledge as the main cause of events related to the use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices. This recognition led to an improved staff training program, and a decrease in similar safety events over time.

With improved rates of reporting via a PSRS, root cause analysis is possible. This identification of safety concerns is necessary for potential improvements in procedures and reduced furture harm.
