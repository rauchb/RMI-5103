## Public Reporting as Quality Improvement

Overall in healthcare, quality measures that are publicly reported improve over time. [[11]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#11) See **Figure A** below, representing the interwoven relationships of public reporting and quality.

### Improving Safety
The exact impacts of publicly reporting safety events is not universally agreed across the healthcare industry. 

Reporting safety events appears to be an effective approach for improving patient safety. Specifically, there is a significant relationship between safety culture and nursing-sensitive patient outcomes (e.g. fewer medication errors, patient falls). [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

By reporting adverse events and near misses, safety specialists are enabled to investigate, identify underlying factors, and mitigate risks. [[9]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#9) Collection of data on safety events within a hospital system can lead to identification of site-specific imrpovements. Then, public reporting can pool common causes of harm for widespread awareness and policy change.

However, most quality improvement requires intervention. In many cases, safety-related interventions are related to education or training for staff. These forms of intervention are significantly less impactful on overall patient safety than active harm mitigation (e.g. process change). [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)
